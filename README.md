# Etch-a-Sketch

This project is a browser version of a mix between a sketchpad and a toy game known as etch-a-sketch. The player can hover the mouse over a box 
to draw anything. You can increase the amount of pixels in the box and also find tools in the side menu with color functions like rainbow mode or shading.

Created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, this project is part of the activities proposed by the open-source free course "The Odin Project".

You can access the game by clicking here:
